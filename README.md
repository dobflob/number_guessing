# Project 1 - A Number Guessing Game
Treehouse Data Analysis Techdegree

## About
A simple number guessing game written in Python where a user tries to guess the number within the provided range. Users receive feedback after each guess, either in the form of 'lower'/'higher' or as an error.

When the game ends, users see their current stats. Stats include the number of guesses (their score for the most recent game), their mean score, median score, and mode score for the active game session. If the user chooses to play again, their current high score will display before they start guessing the next number.

If a player quits the game, the player stats are wiped.
